IMPORTANT:  1-Make sure pylidc is the same version as specified in the requirements.txt
            1-Go to the location of your instalation of the pylidc library (you can know where it is by doing pip show)
            2-Go to the Contour.py file and in line 111 change it to:
                                                                return np.c_[ij, k].astype(np.int64)

            3-Go to the Annotation.py file and change all the np.int to np.int64 (there should only be 2 lines to change)
            4-Go to the Annotation.py file and change all the np.float to np.float64 (there should only be 4 lines to change)
